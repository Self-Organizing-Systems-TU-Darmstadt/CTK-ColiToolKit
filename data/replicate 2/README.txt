README
In the data folder, all results from the flow cytometry measurements on Tuesday 10/06/2025 are placed. An overview of all samples with the original file name, plasmid name, promoter name, inducer, inducer concentration and the new file name can be seen. 

Additionally, I have grouped the data from the flow cytometry into the following folders:

data/basal
Data covering the control strain at 12 different inducer concentrations (IPTG)


data/constitutive
Data covering the various constitutive promoters (J23101 to J23119) with either no inducer (named -No), or with max concentration of one of the inducers (Ara, aTc, or IPTG)


data/gates
Data of the 20 NOT gates at 12 different concentrations of IPTG


data/inputs
Data of the three input promoters at various inducer concentrations. 
Plasmid Promoter	Chemical
pJCM435	PTac		IPTG
pJCM448	PBAD		Ara
pJCM449	PTet		aTc


data/inputs_cross_reactivity
Data of the control strain, and the three input promoters with either no inducer (named -No), or with max concentration of one of the inducers (Ara, aTc, or IPTG)


data/reference
Data of the reference promoter (J23101) spanning a range of 12 IPTG inducer concentrations. 
All should have the same fluorescence levels.
